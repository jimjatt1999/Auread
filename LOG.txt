Auread Project Development Log
================================

Date: 2024-07-20

== Appearance Settings Implementation ==

*   Goal: Implement basic reader appearance settings (theme, font size), inspired by Shiori Reader models.
*   Models:
    *   Created `AppearanceSettings.swift`: Defines `ReaderTheme` enum (Light, Sepia, Dark) and `AppearanceSettings` struct (stores theme raw value, font size float).
    *   Created `SettingsManager.swift`: ObservableObject using `@AppStorage` to persist `AppearanceSettings` as JSON data. Loads defaults if no saved data. Provides `updateTheme` and `updateFontSize` methods.
*   Integration:
    *   Injected `SettingsManager` into SwiftUI environment in `AureadApp.swift`.
    *   Modified `ReaderViewModel.swift`: 
        *   Requires `SettingsManager` in initializer.
        *   Observes `settingsManager.$currentSettings` using Combine `sink`.
        *   Added `applySettings(_:)` method to update Readium navigator's appearance (`editingActions.setAppearance`) and font size (`editingActions.setProperty(key: .fontSize, ...)`).
        *   Calls `applySettings` initially from `navigator(_:viewDidAppear:)` and whenever settings change.
    *   Modified `ReaderView.swift`:
        *   Retrieves `SettingsManager` from environment.
        *   Passes `SettingsManager` to `ReaderViewModel` initializer.
        *   Passes `SettingsManager` to `OptionsMenuView` initializer.
        *   Updated `OptionsMenuView`:
            *   Added segmented picker bound to `settingsManager.currentSettings.theme`.
            *   Added +/- buttons and text display for font size, calling `settingsManager.updateFontSize`.
            *   Adjusted sheet height presentation detent.
    *   Modified `HomeView.swift`: Passes `SettingsManager` from environment to `ReaderView` initializer.
*   Result: User can now change theme (Light/Sepia/Dark) and font size (50%-250%) via the options menu (...) in the reader, and changes are applied live and persist.

== ReaderView Initial Implementation & Fixes ==

*   Goal: Implement EPUB reader view using Readium, handle progress saving.
*   Initial Setup: Integrated EPUBNavigatorViewController within ReaderView.swift using ReaderContainer.
*   Issue: Type mismatch for Navigator Delegate (`ReaderViewModel.swift`).
    *   Fix: Changed ReaderViewModel conformance to EPUBNavigatorDelegate.
*   Issue: Placeholder code in delegate methods (`ReaderViewModel.swift`) and ToC navigation (`ReaderView.swift`).
    *   Fix: Added basic error logging; fixed link resolution (`publication.locate`).
*   Issue: Progress saving/restoring not working; empty Table of Contents (`ReaderView.swift`).
    *   Diagnosis: Incorrect timing for ToC fetch; initial locator not passed correctly; delegate `locationDidChange` not updating state reliably.
    *   Attempt 1: Moved ToC fetch to ViewModel (`ReaderViewModel.swift`), passed initial locator during navigator init (`ReaderContainer`). Delegate not set.
    *   Attempt 2: Restored delegate setting (`ReaderContainer`). Saving failed (threading suspected).
    *   Attempt 3: Dispatched locator update to main thread (`ReaderViewModel.locationDidChange`).
    *   Attempt 4 (Successful Persistence): Moved saving logic into `locationDidChange`; passed BookLibrary/bookID to `ReaderViewModel` init.
*   Issue: Crash due to accessing @EnvironmentObject BookLibrary in `ReaderViewModel.init`.
    *   Fix: Refactored `ReaderView.swift` and `ReaderViewModel.swift` to pass BookLibrary explicitly during init.
*   Issue: `Locator` not `Codable`, preventing saving via JSONEncoder (`BookLibrary.swift`).
    *   Discovery: Found `BookProgress.swift` with `Codable BookPosition` struct and `BookLibrary` extension.
    *   Fix: Removed redundant save/load methods from `BookLibrary.swift`, used existing extension methods.
*   Issue: Progress saving reset after app force-quit (`BookLibrary.swift`).
    *   Diagnosis: Suspected `@AppStorage` reliability issue.
    *   Attempt 1: Added logging, `UserDefaults.synchronize()`. No fix.
    *   Fix: Replaced `@AppStorage` with direct file writing (`library.json`) in `BookLibrary.saveBooks/loadBooks`.

== ReaderView UI Enhancements & Gesture Handling (`ReaderView.swift`) ==

*   Goal: Add progress indicator to `HomeView.swift`, enhance `ReaderView.swift` controls.
*   Feature: Added progress bar/text to `BookItemView.swift`.
    *   Added `getProgression()` method to `BookLibrary` extension (`BookProgress.swift`).
*   Issue: Progress bar showed 0% after ToC navigation.
    *   Fix: Adjusted `BookItemView.swift` condition `progress >= 0`.
*   Feature: Redesigned ReaderView controls:
    *   Replaced `NavigationView` with custom overlay.
    *   Added bottom scrubber slider bound to `totalProgression`.
    *   Added tap-to-toggle controls logic (center tap).
    *   Added floating ellipsis button triggering options `.actionSheet`.
    *   Added top-left close button.
*   Issue: Custom SwiftUI gestures conflicted with Readium's internal gestures.
    *   Attempt 1 (Swipe): Removed custom `DragGesture`, relied on Readium. (Success).
    *   Attempt 2 (Tap): Moved `.onTapGesture` to `ReaderContainer`. (Failure: Blocked gestures).
    *   Attempt 3-5 (Tap): Tried various overlays (`Color.clear`, zoned `HStack`, `.highPriorityGesture`). (Failure: Blocked swipes).
    *   Fix (Successful Tap/Swipe Coexistence): Implemented tap handling via `UIGestureRecognizer` in `ReaderContainer.Coordinator`.
        *   Set `cancelsTouchesInView = false`.
        *   Used `shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith` delegate.
*   Issue: Tap page turns prevented long-press text selection.
    *   Fix: Temporarily disabled edge tap actions (`onTapLeft/onTapRight`) in `Coordinator.handleTap`.
*   Feature: Integrated slider into custom menu sheet (`OptionsMenuView`) triggered by ellipsis.
    *   Removed bottom scrubber bar.
    *   Added frosted glass effect (`.ultraThinMaterial`) to menu sheet and ellipsis button.

== Bookmarking ==

*   Goal: Implement bookmarking functionality.
*   Models: Created `Bookmark.swift`, `Highlight.swift`. Added `bookmarks`/`highlights` arrays to `Book.swift`.
*   Library: Added `add/get/deleteBookmark`, `add/getHighlight`, `findBookmark` functions to `BookLibrary.swift`.
*   UI (`ReaderView.swift`):
    *   Added toggle bookmark button to controls overlay.
    *   Added `BookmarksHighlightsView.swift` sheet, presented from `OptionsMenuView`.
    *   Implemented navigation from bookmark list to reader location.
*   ViewModel (`ReaderViewModel.swift`):
    *   Added `@Published isCurrentLocationBookmarked`.
    *   Updated `locationDidChange` to check bookmark status.
*   Issue: Duplicate bookmarks could be added.
    *   Fix: Added check in `BookLibrary.addBookmark` using `findBookmark`.
*   Issue: Bookmark button didn't reflect current state.
    *   Fix: Updated button icon and action to toggle based on `isCurrentLocationBookmarked`.
*   Issue: Highlighting requires deeper integration with text selection menu (deferred).

**Date:** 2024-07-28 10:25 AM
**Goal:** Fix scope errors for Readium Navigator types in `ReaderViewModel.swift`.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Auread/ReaderViewModel.swift`:**
    *   Modified the `applySettings` function.
    *   Added explicit `ReadiumNavigator.` namespace prefix to `Preferences`, `BoolPreference`, `FloatPreference`, and the keys `.dark`, `.sepia`, and `.fontSize`.
    *   This resolves compiler errors where these types/keys couldn't be found or inferred despite the `import ReadiumNavigator` statement.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Compiler errors persisted for Readium types in `ReaderViewModel.swift` even after cleaning the build folder.

**Resolution:**
*   Applied explicit namespacing (`ReadiumNavigator.TypeName`) to the relevant types and keys within the `applySettings` function.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 10:15 AM
**Goal:** Fix compiler errors related to settings initialization and potentially Readium Navigator types.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Model/SettingsManager.swift`:**
    *   Modified `init()` in both `SettingsManager` and `RefinedSettingsManager`.
    *   Changed initialization logic to first load data directly from `UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: "appearanceSettings")`.
    *   This avoids accessing the `@AppStorage` property wrapper (which uses `self` implicitly) before all stored properties (`currentSettings`) are fully initialized.
    *   Initialized `currentSettings` (or `_currentSettings`) *after* loading the data.
    *   Ensured Combine setup (in `SettingsManager`) or `didSet` observer (in `RefinedSettingsManager`) activates only *after* initialization is complete.
*   **`Auread/Auread/ReaderViewModel.swift`:**
    *   Confirmed `import ReadiumNavigator` was already present.
    *   Compiler errors related to `Preferences`, `BoolPreference`, etc., likely stemmed from Xcode build cache issues or potentially needing explicit namespacing (`ReadiumNavigator.Preferences`). User advised to clean build folder first.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Persistent `'self' used in property access 'settingsData' before all stored properties are initialized` errors in `SettingsManager.swift` initializers.
*   Compiler errors finding Readium Navigator types (`Preferences`, etc.) in `ReaderViewModel.swift` despite the correct import statement.

**Resolution:**
*   Refactored initializers in `SettingsManager.swift` to load from `UserDefaults` directly before initializing other properties.
*   Advised user to clean Xcode build folder (Shift+Cmd+K) to address potential stale errors regarding Readium types. Next step if errors persist is to add explicit namespacing.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 10:35 AM
**Goal:** Fix compiler errors in `ReaderViewModel.swift` related to applying appearance settings.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Auread/ReaderViewModel.swift`:**
    *   Refactored the `applySettings` function.
    *   Removed the use of generic `Preferences`, `BoolPreference`, and `FloatPreference` types.
    *   Now directly initializes `ReadiumNavigator.EPUBPreferences`.
    *   Maps the local `ReaderTheme` enum to the expected `ReadiumNavigator.Theme` enum (`.light`, `.sepia`, `.dark`).
    *   Sets the `fontSize` property in the initializer, converting the `Float` from `AppearanceSettings` to `Double`.
    *   Submits the constructed `EPUBPreferences` object to `navigator.submitPreferences`.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Previous attempts using generic `Preferences` with different namespaces (`ReadiumNavigator`, `ReadiumShared`) failed, indicating these types/keys were incorrect or deprecated for the `submitPreferences` API.

**Resolution:**
*   Switched to using the specific `ReadiumNavigator.EPUBPreferences` type, aligning with documentation about the newer preferences API.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 10:40 AM
**Goal:** Fix app entry point to show the main `HomeView` instead of the default `ContentView`.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/AureadApp.swift`:**
    *   Changed the view presented inside the `WindowGroup` from `ContentView()` to `HomeView()`.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   The application was displaying the placeholder "Hello, world!" (`ContentView`) upon launch.

**Resolution:**
*   Updated `AureadApp.swift` to present `HomeView` as the root view, ensuring the correct initial UI is displayed.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 10:50 AM
**Goal:** Improve bookmark toggle logic to be more robust and responsive.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/ReaderView.swift`:**
    *   Modified the action closure for the bookmark button.
    *   Instead of solely relying on the potentially stale `model.isCurrentLocationBookmarked` state, the action now explicitly calls `bookLibrary.findBookmark(near:)` using the `model.currentLocator` *at the moment the button is tapped*.
    *   If `findBookmark` returns an existing bookmark, it's deleted; otherwise, a new bookmark is added.
    *   The `model.isCurrentLocationBookmarked` state is now updated *immediately* within the button action after adding or deleting, ensuring the button's visual state (`bookmark` vs `bookmark.fill`) updates instantly.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   The previous bookmark toggle logic could be unreliable due to potential race conditions or delays between location changes, state updates (`isCurrentLocationBookmarked`), and button taps.

**Resolution:**
*   Made the bookmark button action idempotent by re-checking the actual bookmark status on tap and updating the UI state immediately for better responsiveness and accuracy.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 11:05 AM
**Goal:** Improve bookmark display name by saving and showing the chapter title.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Model/Bookmark.swift`:** Added `chapterTitle: String?` property to the struct.
*   **`Auread/Model/BookLibrary.swift`:**
    *   Updated `addBookmark` function to accept an optional `title: String?` parameter and save it to the new `Bookmark.chapterTitle`.
    *   Refactored bookmark storage to use a top-level `@Published var bookmarks: [Bookmark]` array in `BookLibrary` instead of nested arrays within `Book` objects.
    *   Added `saveBookmarks()` and `loadBookmarks()` methods for dedicated persistence of the top-level array.
    *   Added a `dataLock` (NSLock) for thread safety around bookmark array modifications.
    *   Updated `getBookmarks` and `deleteBookmark` to work with the top-level array and lock.
    *   Updated `findBookmark` to decode the full `Locator` from `locatorData` for comparison (previously assumed `BookPosition`).
*   **`Auread/Auread/ReaderViewModel.swift`:**
    *   Added `@Published var currentChapterTitle: String?`.
    *   Updated `navigator(_:locationDidChange:)` to set `currentChapterTitle = locator.title`.
*   **`Auread/ReaderView.swift`:** Updated the `addBookmark` call in the bookmark button action to pass `model.currentChapterTitle`.
*   **`Auread/BookmarksHighlightsView.swift`:**
    *   Updated `BookmarkRow` view.
    *   Added `displayTitle` computed property to show `bookmark.chapterTitle` preferentially, falling back to `locator.title` (decoded from `locatorData`), then "Unknown Chapter".
    *   Added `displaySubtitle` computed property to show page number or progression, falling back to creation date.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Bookmarks were often displayed with generic titles like "Untitled" because the `locator.title` provided by Readium wasn't always available or accurate when the bookmark was created/saved.
*   Original `Bookmark` struct in the user's code was slightly different than assumed (used `locatorData`, `creationDate`).
*   Bookmark persistence logic was previously tied to saving the whole `BookLibrary` (which saved `Book` objects containing bookmark arrays). This was refactored for clarity and potentially better performance.

**Resolution:**
*   Captured the `locator.title` available at the time of bookmark creation and stored it explicitly in the `Bookmark` object.
*   Updated the display logic to use this stored title, improving the user experience in the bookmarks list.
*   Refactored bookmark storage and persistence to be handled directly by `BookLibrary` using a dedicated array and save/load functions, improving separation of concerns and adding thread safety.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 11:15 AM
**Goal:** Fix bookmark saving/loading and display issues caused by attempting to directly encode/decode non-Codable `Locator`.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Model/BookLibrary.swift`:**
    *   Modified `addBookmark`: Now creates a `Codable` `BookPosition` from the `Locator` and encodes *that* into the `locatorData` field of the `Bookmark`. It also uses the explicitly passed `title` first, falling back to `position.resourceTitle` if the passed title is nil.
    *   Modified `findBookmark`: Now decodes `BookPosition` from the stored `locatorData` and compares properties (`href`, `totalProgression`) to find nearby bookmarks.
*   **`Auread/BookmarksHighlightsView.swift`:**
    *   Added `decodePosition` helper to safely decode `BookPosition` from `Data`.
    *   Updated `BookmarkRow`: `displayTitle` helper now uses `bookmark.chapterTitle` first, then falls back to the title from the decoded `BookPosition` (`position.resourceTitle`), then "Unknown Chapter". `displaySubtitle` helper uses `position.position` (page) or `position.totalProgression` from the decoded `BookPosition`.
    *   Updated `handleItemSelection`: Decodes `BookPosition` from the `locatorData` and then calls `position.asLocator()` to get the `Locator` object required for navigation.
    *   Fixed date formatting in `displaySubtitle`: Changed `Text(..., style: .date)` to `Text(bookmark.creationDate.formatted(date: .abbreviated, time: .omitted))`.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Compiler errors indicated `Locator` does not conform to `Decodable`, preventing direct JSON encoding/decoding.
*   Compiler errors indicated incorrect usage of `style: .date` for `Text` date formatting.

**Resolution:**
*   Reverted bookmark persistence logic to use the `Codable` `BookPosition` struct (assumed to exist from prior work) for storing location data, instead of attempting to encode the entire `Locator`.
*   Updated bookmark display logic to decode `BookPosition` and use its properties along with the explicitly saved `chapterTitle`.
*   Corrected date formatting syntax using the `.formatted()` modifier.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 11:25 AM
**Goal:** Fix initialization errors in `BookLibrary.swift`.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Model/BookLibrary.swift`:**
    *   Modified `init()`:
        *   Determines file paths for bookmarks and highlights and assigns them to `self.bookmarksFilePath` and `self.highlightsFilePath` *before* calling any load methods.
        *   Calls `loadBooks()`, `loadBookmarks()`, and the newly added `loadHighlights()` *after* all stored properties have been initialized.
    *   Added `saveHighlights()` and `loadHighlights()` methods for dedicated persistence of the top-level `highlights` array.
    *   Updated `addHighlight`, `getHighlights`, and added `deleteHighlight` to use the top-level `highlights` array and the `dataLock` for thread safety, mirroring the bookmark logic.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Compiler errors: `'self' used in method call 'loadBooks' before all stored properties are initialized` and `Return from initializer without initializing all stored properties`.
*   This was because `loadBooks()` was called before `bookmarksFilePath` and `highlightsFilePath` were initialized.

**Resolution:**
*   Ensured all stored properties (especially file paths) are initialized in `init()` *before* calling methods that might depend on them (`loadBooks`, `loadBookmarks`, `loadHighlights`).
*   Added missing persistence logic for highlights.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 11:30 AM
**Goal:** Fix issue where book opening resumes at chapter start instead of the exact last read location.

**Issue:**
*   The application correctly saved the overall book progress (`totalProgression`) and the chapter (`href`), but when reopening the book, it always started at the beginning of the last read chapter.

**Diagnosis:**
*   Analyzed `BookProgress.swift`, `ReaderViewModel.swift`, and `ReaderView.swift`.
*   The `BookPosition` struct used for saving the location stored `totalProgression` and `position` (page index) but not `progression` (the fractional progress *within* the current chapter/resource).
*   When recreating the Readium `Locator` from the saved `BookPosition` (in `BookPosition.asLocator()`), the `locations.progression` field was not being set.
*   It's likely the Readium navigator uses `locations.progression` to determine the precise scroll position within a resource, and without it, defaults to the beginning (progression 0.0).

**Fix:**
*   Modified `Auread/Model/BookProgress.swift`:
    *   Added `progression: Double?` property to the `BookPosition` struct.
    *   Updated the `BookPosition(from locator: Locator)` initializer to store `locator.locations.progression`.
    *   Updated the `asLocator()` method to set `locations.progression` using the stored value when recreating the `Locator`.
    *   Updated logging statements to include the `progression` value.

**Resolution:**
*   By saving and restoring the `progression` within the resource, the navigator should now have the exact information needed to resume reading at the precise last location.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 12:00 PM
**Goal:** Implement in-book search functionality with result highlighting.

**Changes:**
*   **`Auread/Auread/ReaderViewModel.swift`:**
    *   Added state variables (`searchQuery`, `searchResults`, `isSearching`, `activeSearchHighlightID`, `searchResultCount`).
    *   Added internal properties (`searchIterator`, `currentSearchTask`, `currentLoadPageTask`).
    *   Implemented `beginSearch()`: Initiates search using `publication.search()`, gets `SearchIterator`.
    *   Implemented `loadNextSearchResultsPage()`: Loads the next page of results from `SearchIterator`.
    *   Implemented `cancelSearch()`: Cancels tasks, closes iterator, clears state and highlights.
    *   Implemented `navigateToSearchResult()`: Navigates to the `Locator` using `navigator.go(to:)` and then calls `applySearchHighlight()`.
    *   Implemented `applySearchHighlight()`: Creates a `Decoration` with `.highlight` style and applies it using `navigator.apply(decorations:inGroup:)`.
    *   Implemented `clearSearchHighlight()`: Calls `navigator.apply([], inGroup: "search")`.
*   **`Auread/SearchView.swift` (New File):**
    *   Created a new SwiftUI view to handle search UI.
    *   Includes `TextField` for input, bound to `ReaderViewModel.searchQuery`.
    *   Displays results in a `List`, using `SearchResultRow`.
    *   `SearchResultRow` shows context (`locator.text`) and bolds the highlighted term.
    *   Handles triggering search (`beginSearch`), pagination (`loadNextSearchResultsPage`), navigation (`navigateToSearchResult`), and cancellation (`cancelSearch`).
*   **`Auread/ReaderView.swift`:**
    *   Added `@State private var showSearchView`.
    *   Added a `.sheet(isPresented: $showSearchView)` modifier to present `SearchView`.
    *   Modified `OptionsMenuView` to accept `$showSearchView` binding.
    *   Updated the "Search" button action in `OptionsMenuView` to set `showSearchView = true` and dismiss the options menu.

**Issues Encountered:**
*   Initial code search didn't find specific `publication.search()` or `navigator.applyDecorations()` methods, requiring a web search.
*   Web search confirmed the existence and general usage pattern of Readium's `SearchIterator` and Decoration API.

**Resolution:**
*   Implemented search using the asynchronous `SearchIterator` pattern.
*   Implemented result highlighting using the Decoration API (`navigator.apply`).
*   Created a dedicated `SearchView` for the user interface.
*   Integrated the `SearchView` presentation into `ReaderView` via the options menu.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 12:15 PM
**Goal:** Confirm search feature works and log completion.

**Status:**
*   User confirmed that the search functionality (entering query, seeing results, navigating, and highlighting) is working as expected.
*   The highlight applied from search results persists until the search is cancelled or a new search is performed.

**Goal:** Remove unused `navigator(_:didTapHighlight:)` function from `ReaderViewModel.swift`.

**Actions:**
*   Attempted to remove the function using `edit_file` with context lines, but failed due to file reading errors.
*   Attempted to remove the function using `edit_file` by providing the exact function signature, but the apply model reported no changes.
*   Used `grep_search` to locate the function signature `func navigator(_ navigator: Navigator, didTapHighlight annotation: HighlightAnnotation)`.

**Result:** `grep_search` reported no matches, indicating the function was already absent or removed previously. Task considered complete.

**Date:** 2024-07-28 (Afternoon/Evening)
**Goal:** Implement user-triggered text highlighting.

**Attempt 1 (EditingAction):**
*   Added custom `EditingAction` ("Highlight") to `EPUBNavigatorViewController.Configuration` targeting a method in `ReaderContainer.Coordinator`.
*   **Issue:** "Highlight" option did not appear in the text selection menu, or tapping it did not trigger the Coordinator method (no logs).

**Attempt 2 (EditingAction - ViewModel Target):**
*   Moved the `@objc func handleHighlightSelection` method to `ReaderViewModel`.
*   Updated the `#selector` in the `EditingAction` to target the ViewModel method.
*   **Issue:** Still did not work; action likely not triggered or reachable in responder chain.

**Attempt 3 (Conditional Floating Button):**
*   Used `navigator(_:didSelect:)` delegate in ViewModel to track `currentSelectionInfo` state.
*   Added a floating button to `ReaderView` visible only when `model.currentSelectionInfo != nil`.
*   Button action called `model.createHighlightForCurrentSelection()`.
*   **Issue:** Persistent, inexplicable compiler errors (`Referencing subscript 'subscript(dynamicMember:)' requires wrapper...`, `Value of type 'ReaderViewModel' has no dynamic member...`) when accessing `model.currentSelectionInfo` in the `if` condition, despite cleaning build folder and deleting DerivedData.
*   **Workaround Tried:** Using `.onReceive(model.$currentSelectionInfo)` to update a local `@State` variable and using *that* for the `if` condition.
*   **Issue:** Compiler errors shifted to the `.onReceive` modifier and the button's action closure (`Cannot call value of non-function type 'Binding<Subject>'`).

**Attempt 4 (Explicit Top Bar Button):**
*   Removed selection tracking state from ViewModel.
*   Added a *permanent* highlight button to the top bar in `ReaderView`.
*   Button action called `model.attemptHighlightCurrentSelection()`, which internally checked `navigator.currentSelection`.
*   **Issue:** The same persistent compiler errors reappeared when trying to call `model.attemptHighlightCurrentSelection()` from the button action, even when wrapped in a `Task { ... }`.

**Attempt 5 (Combine PassthroughSubject):**
*   Added `PassthroughSubject` (`highlightTrigger`) to ViewModel.
*   Subscribed to subject in ViewModel's `init` to call `attemptHighlightCurrentSelection`.
*   Button action in `ReaderView` changed to simply call `model.highlightTrigger.send()`.
*   **Issue:** The exact same persistent compiler errors (`Referencing subscript requires wrapper`, `no dynamic member`, `Cannot call value of non-function type Binding<Subject>`) occurred on the `model.highlightTrigger.send()` line.

**Attempt 6 (Combine PassthroughSubject - Revisited):**
*   Re-added `PassthroughSubject` (`manualHighlightTrigger`) to ViewModel and subscription.
*   Added permanent paint palette button to top bar calling `model.manualHighlightTrigger.send()`.
*   **Issue:** The exact same persistent compiler errors occurred again on the `.send()` call.

**Decision:** Abandoning attempts to trigger highlighting via direct button actions (standard, Task, Combine) or custom menus within `ReaderView` due to persistent, blocking compiler errors related to accessing the `@StateObject model`. This indicates a likely Xcode build system or SwiftUI/UIViewControllerRepresentable integration bug within this project's context. Highlighting triggered *from user text selection interaction* is currently blocked.
